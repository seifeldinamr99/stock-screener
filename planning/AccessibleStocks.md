# Accessible Stocks Feature Overview

## Intent
Provide a duplicate experience of the existing **Classifiers** page under the new title **Accessible Stocks**, while keeping its data isolated. The page should render the same UI but pull from an empty dataset so that future accessibleâ€‘specific information can be populated independently of the main classifier universe.

---

## Backend Updates

- Added a parallel set of models (`AccessibleExchange`, `AccessibleSector`, `AccessibleIndustry`, `AccessibleStock`, `AccessibleHistoricalPrice`) with migrations so Accessible data is stored separately from the primary classifiers tables.
- Introduced dataset routing helpers inside `backend/screener/views.py`. Endpoints now inspect a `dataset` query parameter (`classifier` by default, `accessible` to switch) and dynamically bind to the correct models, serializers, filter sets, and querysets.
- Updated supporting endpoints (`stocks/filter_options`, `stocks/sector-industry-counts`, `filtered-stats`, `database_stats`, `sectors/<sector>/industries/`) to honor the dataset selection.
- Serializer layer mirrors the additional models (`Accessible*Serializer` classes) so response payloads stay consistent across datasets.

**Migration:** `backend/screener/migrations/0007_accessibleexchange_accessiblesector_and_more.py`

## Frontend Updates

- `useClassifierData` hook now accepts a `datasetKey` argument (defaults to `classifier`) and forwards it through every API request.
- `ClassifiersPage` component takes `datasetKey`, `sectorsTitle`, and `sectorsEmptyMessage` props so downstream pages can reuse the layout with custom copy.
- `SectorsView` supports configurable title and empty state message strings.
- New page component `AccessibleStocksPage` wraps `ClassifiersPage` with `datasetKey="accessible"` and tailored copy.
- Navigation (`App.js`) adds an **Accessible Stocks** button and renders the new page when selected.

### How It Was Made

- The backend now has a parallel model hierarchy (`AccessibleExchange`, `AccessibleSector`, `AccessibleIndustry`, `AccessibleStock`, `AccessibleHistoricalPrice`) with serializers and a migration, ensuring accessible data lives in its own tables.
- View logic resolves a `dataset` query parameter so every affected endpoint (filter options, sector/industry counts, filtered stats, database stats, sector industries, and stock profiles/history) dynamically targets either the classifier or accessible tables.
- On the frontend, `useClassifierData` forwards a `datasetKey` to every fetch, and `ClassifiersPage`/`SectorsView` accept customizable props. A new `AccessibleStocksPage` component wires those pieces together and is surfaced via an additional navigation tab in `App.js`.

## How to Use

### Backend
- Migrations already generated and applied. Run `python pythonScripts/manage.py migrate` if needed in another environment.
- Supply `dataset=accessible` in query strings to interact with the accessible dataset; omit the param (or set `classifier`) for the original data.

### Frontend
- Navigate via the header button to load the Accessible Stocks UI.
- All filters and interactions behave identically to Classifiers but will show empty results until the new tables are populated.

---

## Testing Notes

- Existing backend test suite (`pythonScripts/manage.py test screener`) currently fails because the historical prices tests patch `screener.management.commands.historical_prices`, yet the module lookup fails during mocking. The failure predates these changes; follow-up required to adjust test imports or module resolutions.

---

## Next Steps

1. Populate the `Accessible*` tables with the appropriate dataset when ready.
2. Address the historical prices test patching issue to restore a clean test run.
3. Consider surfacing a more descriptive empty-state experience once data requirements are finalized.
